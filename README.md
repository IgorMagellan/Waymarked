# Waymarked Overlay

Waymarked trails overlay
 
It was planned as part of another theme - Tiramisu. It is an adapted single piece of code from the Elevate theme for marked routes as well as new **osmc:symbols** .

The Tiramisu theme extension had to be temporarily abandoned due to a significant increase in the processing time of the theme when switching to it during the journey.

Let it work as an overlay for now.
